Power BI Dashboard Project: Netflix Content Analysis

Objective: To develop a comprehensive "Netflix Content Dashboard" toprovide deep insights into 
key performance metrics and trends such as genre popularity, distribution of content
production across different countries and trends in movies vs tv show production.

Steps: 

1. Basic Checks: At first, I inspected the data to know number of records, number of columns and 
   the types of data, etc. so that I can gain detailed understanding of the data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Checked for the presence of null values and duplicated rows and 
   handled these issues. Applied various DAX functions such as CALCULATE, SWITCH, COUNT and SEARCH, etc. 
   to create new measures and calculated columns as per the requirement.

3. Data Visualization: Applied various visualization techniques like pie chart, line plot and column charts, 
   etc. to create dashboards so that patterns can be found from the data.

4. Deriving Insights: At the final stage, I derived various insights from the created Dashboard. 
   The insights are as follows:
  
  (a) Out of 8807 contents on Netflix, movies constitute 69.62% (6131) and tv shows constitute 30.38% (2676)
      of the total number of contents.
  
  (b) Most number of contents available on Netflix is produced by the United States. Total 3210 contents on 
      Netflix are produced by the United States which constitutes 36.44% of the total contents.
  
  (c) India stands at the second place. Total 1008 contents on Netflix are produced by India which
      is just 31% of the contents produced by the United States.

  (d) Most number of contents belong to genre “Drama”. It is followed by genre “Comedy” and “Action & Adventure".

  (e) Most of the contents belong to category “TV-MA”. It accounts for 36.5% of the total number of contents.
     It is followed by “TV-14” and “TV-PG” .

  (f) 2015 onwards, number of contents on Netflix has increased by huge numbers. In 2015, there were only
      82 contents on the Netflix which increased to 429 in 2016. Maximum number of content belongs to
      post 2000 release.
  
  (g) Almost half of the movies are 1 hour to 2 hours long in duration. Additionally, 67% of tv shows
      are just 1 season long.
