Business Case

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

Python Packages Used 

There are different packages used for different purpose. These are mentioned below:

Data Manipulation : Pandas and NumPy packages are used for importing, cleaning and manipulating the dataset.

Data Visualization : Matplotlib and Seaborn packages are used for plotting diagrams and for exploratory data analysis.

Machine Learning : Scikit and TensorFlow packages are used to build models.

There have been done basic checks, data preprocessing, model building and model evaluation.

Models Applied 

I have applied several machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, support vector classifier, and naive bayes.
Besides these, I have also applied deep learning algorithms like artifical neural network and convolutional neural network.

Model Evaluation  

Artificial Neural Network : Testing Score-- 97.6%
Convolutional Neural Network : Testing Score-- 98.3%
Logistic Regression : Testing Score-- 92.5% and Training Score-- 93.3%
Decision Tree : Testing Score-- 87.7% and Training Score-- 100%
